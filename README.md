# ENPM692 Manufacturing and Automation
The manufacturing of space hardware is a very precise and controlled process. Space mechanisms are unique because there is no way of servicing them once they are launched. Because of this limitation, a lot of time and money is spent on making sure the mechanism is robust and the hardware manufactured will work during the separation. This report will focus on the manufacturing process of a small aerospace hardware manufacturer - Planetary Systems Corp (PSC). PSC focuses on building separation systems that will separate small scale satellites from the rocket once they reach orbit. These are mission critical systems that can cost millions of dollars if they do not perform properly. Their manufacturing process is very intricate and there are ways they can improve the existing processes while maintaining their level of confidence in their systems. A manufacturing simulation software is used to identify areas of improvement to optimize their processes. Optimizing these processes will lead to increased volume of production, shorter lead times, lower costs, and greater reliability and repeatability.
